    "In this section of the course, we will cover _knowledge graph construction_ or how to construct knowledge graphs from both _natural networks_ and _structural networks_. In the lecture I described _knowledge graph construction_ as the process of building a knowledge graph from raw data using ETL, data transformations or Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n",
