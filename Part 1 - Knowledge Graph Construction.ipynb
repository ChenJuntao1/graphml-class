    "Part 1: Knowledge Graph Construction\n",
    "====================================\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section of the course, we will cover _knowledge graph construction_ or how to construct knowledge graphs from both _natural networks_ and _structural networks_. In the lecture I described _knowledge graph construction_ as the process of building a knowledge graph from raw data using ETL, data transformations or Natural Language Processing (NLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of networks in common use: simple and heterogeneous networks. We're going to start out building a simple network where nodes are _academic papers_ and edges are _citations between papers_.\n",

    "An excellent resource for the first two parts of this course, **Knowledge Graph Construction** and **Network Science** is the [Network Science (CC4063 / CC4095)](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~pribeiro/aulas/ns2122/) class taught by [Pedro Ribeiro](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~pribeiro/) at the [Center for Research in Advanced Computing Systems](https://cracs.fc.up.pt/), part of the [Computer Science Department](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/site/) of the [University of Porto](https://www.up.pt/portal/en/).\n",

    "# ETL for a Simple, Natural Graph: High-energy Physics Theory Citation Network\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to start out by building a knowledge graph from an existing edge list and then add properties to it. We'll be using the [High-energy physics theory citation network](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-HepTh.html) from [Stanford SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/index.html). SNAP has many large network datasets available in the [Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes the following files, which we will combine:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Citation graph edge list](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-HepTh.txt.gz) contains node ID pairs. Node IDs are standard paper identifiers. This will build the core structure of our network.\n",
    "* [Paper metadata](cit-HepTh-abstracts.tar.gz) including abstracts. This will add propertis to our network.\n",
    "* [Publishing dates on arXiv](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-HepTh-dates.txt.gz) will make our citation network a temporal [Directed-Acyclic-Graph (DAG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) since one paper can't cite another before it is written and there are no reciprocal edges. While we don't focus on this, it does affect our analysis."
