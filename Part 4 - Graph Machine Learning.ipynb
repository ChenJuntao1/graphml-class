    "# Graph Machine Learning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Having explored network science, we are about to dive into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The best introduction to GNNs is a long blog post by []() entitled [A Gentle Introduction to Graph Neural Networks](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/) which the authors have _generously_ licensed under the Creative Commons. This lets me utilize their work to explain how GNNs work while providing source code along with it to bring your theoretical understanding to a practical one.\n",

    "Knowledge graphs are at the peak of the Gartner hype cycle and graph neural networks (GNNs) are soon to be high on the ramp because they tap and unlock the potential of enterprise knowledge graphs. Data lakes put data in one place, knowledge graphs link datasets together and graph neural networks automate business processes using data from across an enterprise. \n",
