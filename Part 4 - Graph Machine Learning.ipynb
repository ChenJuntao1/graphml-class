    "\n",
    "[DGL or Deep Graph Library](https://dgl.ai) is the simplest way to get started with graph machine learning using graph neural networks (GNNs).\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will cover a few common operations with each major task type we covered in the lecture: node-level, edge-level, subgraph-level and graph-level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Node-Level Tasks: Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Node-level tasks usually involve property prediction - classifying nodes into categories or regressing one of their numeric properties. We'll cover both.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the network science section of this course, we will start with a Text Attributed Graph (TAG) called a Citation Graph. We are going to use the [CORA dataset](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA), [described by Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cora) as:\n",

    "> Introduced by Andrew McCallum et al. in [Automating the Construction of Internet Portals with Machine Learning](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1009953814988)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The Cora dataset consists of 2708 scientific publications classified into one of seven classes. The citation network consists of 5429 links. Each publication in the dataset is described by a 0/1-valued word vector indicating the absence/presence of the corresponding word from the dictionary. The dictionary consists of 1433 unique words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CORA Node Features: Bag of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "Note... the features for this network are a [Bag of Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) model: simple and _sparse_ rather than modern text representations which are _dense_, distributed representations in the form of language models or [embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/meet-ais-multitool-vector-embeddings). Each node has a row in the feature matrix and each of 1,433 unique words get a column with the word count. Before [Word2Vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) introduced text embeddings in 2013, the features for NLP problems were mostly 0s, with a few non-zero values.\n",

    "\n",
    "The [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) prevented NLP applications from realizing their modern capabilities - the more words that were added, the more dimensions the features data got and the more dimensions you add to a _sparse_ feature vector... the more all the values of that vector start to approximate the same value. They stretch out over many dimensions and look the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings like Word2Vec related _sparse representations_ of words to the text around them by storing a middle layer of a neural network, creating _dense representations_.\n",

    "\n",
    "These are very useful because the dimensions of the feature vector correspond to particular semantics, and because you can compare two dense vectors and get a sense of how similar the objects the represent are. This is very useful for information retreival applications like search and clustering.\n",

    "\n",
    "We could use a language model or large language model (LLM) to embed the features or the original text and get better performance from our GCN. However, it is good to start simple and worry about feature engineering lately... you can spend an endless amount of time over optimizing a task nobody cares about. Make sure they want the prototype before you engineer incredible performance. A Bag of Words representation is a fine start.\n",
